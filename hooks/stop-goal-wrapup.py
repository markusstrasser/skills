"""Stop hook: overnight /goal run controller (wrap-up ritual + goal continuation).

Opt-in per run via `just goal-night` (or manually: `.claude/goal-run` file whose
content = ritual threshold in tokens; launch with CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW
~10% above it). Stop = the "agent finished a meaningful unit of work" event, so
one hook drives the whole night:

  Stop fires
    ├─ context >= ritual threshold and ritual not yet prompted
    │    → block ONCE with the wrap-up ritual (do it with full context;
    │      native auto-compact fires next turn; precompact-goal-guard.py
    │      enforces ordering + injects summarizer instructions)
    ├─ goal not done, not human-blocked, continuation budget left
    │    → block with the continuation prompt (goal keeps going after compaction)
    └─ .claude/goal-done / .claude/goal-blocked / budget exhausted → allow stop

Escapes the agent controls: touch .claude/goal-done (goal complete + verified),
touch .claude/goal-blocked (write HUMAN.md first). Operator disarm: rm .claude/goal-run.
Continuation budget (MAX_CONTINUES) bounds a pathological spin; PostCompact re-arms
the ritual for the next fill cycle. Fail-open everywhere (P10).

Context measurement: last assistant usage in the transcript =
input_tokens + cache_read + cache_creation.

WRAPUP_PROMPT = """CONTEXT THRESHOLD REACHED ({ctx:,} >= {thr:,} tokens) — run the wrap-up ritual NOW, while full context exists. Order matters:

1. COMMIT everything finished (granular, semantic). Post-compaction verification trusts git, not memory — uncommitted work risks being hallucinated-as-done after the summary.
2. Session sweep: anything to improve, eradicate, or rethink with smart tooling, hooks, skills, MCPs, or goal rethinking? Wasted effort? Bad infrastructure? What could a future agent leverage? Only long-term, deep, STRICTLY better changes — no noise, no iatrogenic harm, no backward-compat cruft. "Nothing strictly better" is a fine answer.
3. Run /rsi.
4. Spend remaining full-context leverage: loose ends only this context can tie off; update docs/indexes for files this session touched; record path-dependent decisions in decisions/.
5. Rewrite .claude/checkpoint.md as the post-compact re-entry brief:
   GOAL — the /goal verbatim.
   FRONTS — per-front status (done / in-flight / blocked) with evidence (commit SHAs, paths).
   NEXT — the 2-3 highest-value next actions, with exact commands.
   VERIFY — commands the post-compact agent must run before trusting state (git log --oneline -10, test/gate commands). Never carry bare numbers across the boundary — carry the command that produces them.
   ASKS — anything for the human (also append to HUMAN.md).
6. End your turn normally. Native auto-compact fires on a subsequent turn (the PreCompact guard passes once this ritual has been prompted); the goal continues after."""

CONTINUE_PROMPT = """GOAL-RUN ACTIVE (continuation {n}/{cap}) — the goal is not marked done; keep going.
- If you just compacted: re-orient from .claude/checkpoint.md and VERIFY claimed work against git log / the checkpoint's VERIFY commands before building on it — compaction summaries hallucinate completions.
- Advance the highest-value front. Run the portfolio (grind subagents / heretic on what just landed / scout / meta) rather than a single serial thread; don't idle, don't re-derive settled state.
- Goal fully done AND verified → touch .claude/goal-done, write the final summary, stop.
- Genuinely blocked on the human with no other front progressable → append the ask to HUMAN.md, touch .claude/goal-blocked, stop."""
