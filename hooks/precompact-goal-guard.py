"""PreCompact hook: goal-run ordering guard + compaction quality instructions.

Only active when `.claude/goal-run` exists (overnight /goal opt-in marker).

Ordering guard: an AUTO compaction attempt before the wrap-up ritual has been
prompted (no `.claude/goal-wrapup-fired`) is blocked — the binary continues
uncompacted and re-triggers next turn (willRetriggerNextTurn), by which time
the Stop hook has injected the ritual. Blocks are capped (5) so a pathological
session can't ride uncompacted into the hard context limit; set the goal-run
window (settings autoCompactWindow, floor 80K) well under the model window so
blocked attempts have real headroom.

Quality injection: on allowed compactions, stdout becomes the summarizer's
customInstructions (binary-verified: PreCompact hook output -> newCustomInstructions).
