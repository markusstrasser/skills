# Cross-Model Review Workflow

Same-model peer review is a martingale — no expected correctness improvement (ACL 2025, arXiv:2508.17536). Cross-model review provides real adversarial pressure because models have different failure modes, training biases, and blind spots.

## Default Migration Stance

Unless the user explicitly says compatibility matters, treat the target change as a breaking refactor with full migration.

- Challenge wrappers, adapters, dual-read/dual-write paths, fallback reads, and "temporary" bridges as liabilities, not prudent defaults.
- Prefer direct caller migration and old-path deletion over coexistence plans.
- If compatibility is genuinely required, name the live boundary, why it must remain, and the removal condition. Unnamed future-proofing is design noise.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | Default, or explicit `/review model [topic]` | Adversarial cross-model review via Gemini + GPT |
| `verify` | `/review verify <report>` | Fact-check LLM findings against actual code |
| `close` | `/review close` | Post-implementation: tests, review, caught-red-handed loop |

**Auto-routing (when no mode specified):**
- Recent plan in `.claude/plans/` with commits since plan start → `close`
- Recent findings/audit output in context → `verify`
- Otherwise → `model`

## Mode: model — Cross-Model Adversarial Review

**Purpose:** Convergent/critical only — find what's wrong. For divergent ideation, use `/brainstorm`.

See `lenses/adversarial-review.md` for full dispatch methodology, axis descriptions, depth presets, per-model prompts, and known issues.

### 1. Assemble Context

Write review material to a single context file.

**Pre-flight — scope declaration (mandatory):** Include a `## Scope` block near the top:
- **Target users:** personal / team / multi-tenant / public
- **Scale:** current entity counts AND designed-for scale (e.g., "currently 40 compounds, designed for thousands of subjects")
- **Rate of change:** how often does new data arrive?

This prevents the #1 review failure mode: models optimizing for the wrong scale. Evidence: selve UMLS review (2026-04-06) — GPT scored a plan 27/100 as "over-engineered for 105 personal entities" when the actual scope was multi-user scalable.

**Constitutional anchoring:** Check for constitution (`## Constitution` in CLAUDE.md) and GOALS.md. Include as preamble if found.

See `references/context-assembly.md` for detailed context gathering (narrow, broad, auto-assembled).

#### Context Anti-Patterns

Common review biases — check your context for these before analysis:

| Anti-pattern | How it biases | Fix |
|-------------|--------------|-----|
| **Scale ambiguity** — large number without clarifying which ops touch it | Models optimize for the large number even when the change affects a small boundary | Include concrete volumes at the decision boundary |
| **Priming alternatives** — listing tools/packages in the prompt | Models evaluate named alternatives favorably instead of finding flaws | For convergent: "find what's wrong" only. For alternatives: use `/brainstorm` or the `alternatives` axis |
| **Framing incumbents as limited** — describing existing tools by narrow current use | Models treat incumbent as constrained | Frame by capability: "Pydantic v2 is established (13 models, 100% typed). Question: extend to output schemas?" |
| **Missing boundary volumes** — not stating how many objects schemas will process | Models default to optimizing for largest number in context | Always include: "Largest output: N entries." |
| **"Rethink entirely" in convergent** — asking for alternatives alongside finding problems | Models dodge critique by proposing alternatives | Keep convergent and divergent separate |
| **Presupposing new infra should exist** — reviewing NEW system without incident history | Models critique within frame instead of questioning it | Include incident history. Prompt: "cite the specific past incident each component prevents. If none, say SPECULATIVE." |
| **Ambiguous domain terminology** — terms that mean different things in different contexts | Models share the same misread | Define terms precisely. Disambiguate similar-named systems on first use. |
| **Missing project identity** in cross-project reviews | Models apply principles too literally to unfamiliar projects | Include 2-3 line identity per project |
| **Missing scope declaration** — not stating target users and designed-for scale | Models assume personal/small when reviewing shared infra, or assume production when reviewing prototypes | Always include scope block (see above) |

### 2. Dispatch

**Always use the script.** It handles: context assembly, constitutional preamble injection, parallel dispatch to Gemini + GPT via the shared dispatch core, extraction, and disposition generation.

```bash
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/model-review.py \
  --context context.md \
  --topic "$TOPIC" \
  --project "$(pwd)" \
  "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Set `timeout: 660000` on the Bash tool call. See `references/dispatch.md` for `--questions`, `--context-files`, depth presets, effort levels, and troubleshooting.

**Model-specific prompting:** Before assembling context, consult `/model-guide` for per-model rules. Key: GPT-5.4 context should use XML `<doc>` tags, Gemini query goes at END. See `references/dispatch.md § Context Formatting` for the full checklist.

**Effort levels:** Default `high` is correct for reviews. Use `xhigh` only for formal math verification. See `references/dispatch.md § Reasoning Effort Selection`.

**GPT-only multi-query pattern:** For deep dives where you want multiple focused attack vectors, dispatch 2-3 GPT-5.4 `high` queries in parallel with different questions each, rather than one mega-query. More signal per unit time.

#### Depth Presets

| Preset | Axes | When |
|--------|------|------|
| `standard` (default) | arch (Gemini) + formal (GPT-5.4) | Most reviews |
| `--axes simple` | combined Gemini Pro | Config tweaks, refreshes |
| `--axes deep` | arch + formal + domain + mechanical | Structural changes, domain-dense |
| `--axes full` | all 5 | Shared infra, clinical, high-stakes |

**Genomics classification review** (monthly or after >10 commits to LR-engine/scoring): Use `--axes formal,domain`. GPT-5.4 found 11 conceptual/mathematical bugs for $6.54 — the only detector for incoherent Bayes.

### 3. Read Both Outputs and Synthesize

Read both review outputs. You are the merger — you have both in context and can cross-reference directly.

**For each finding from either model:**
1. **Verify code claims** — read the actual file. Models frequently cite wrong line numbers, invent function names.
2. **Check if both models found it** — cross-model agreement is the strongest signal.
3. **Grep "missing feature" claims** — the feature may already exist.

**Trust ranking:**

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Both models found it + you verified in code | Fix it |
| One model found it + you verified in code | Fix it |
| Both agree but unverified | Verify first |
| Single model, unverified | Investigate before acting |
| Contradicts what you see in the code | Discard |

**Before implementing:** Ask yourself two questions:
1. Where do you disagree with the models? ("Nowhere" is valid.)
2. What context did you have that they didn't?

Don't let rigorous-looking analysis override what you can see in the code.

### 4. Act on Findings

**The synthesis is not the deliverable — the updated artifact is.**

- **Verified findings:** Apply directly. Don't ask permission.
- **Context depleted:** Offer plan-mode handoff.
- **All deferred/rejected:** The synthesis is the deliverable.

### Artifact Handoff

Write summary JSON to `~/.claude/artifacts/$(basename $PWD)/model-review-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json` with: skill, project, date, topic, include/defer/reject counts, key_findings[]. Used by project-upgrade as a cache gate.

---

## Mode: verify — Fact-Check LLM Findings

Standalone verification of LLM-generated audit findings. Use after `model` mode, `/dispatch-research`, `/project-upgrade`, or any automated audit that produces file-specific claims.

See `lenses/verification.md` for the full procedure.

### When to Use

- After `model` mode produces codebase critique
- After `/dispatch-research` generates audit findings
- After `/project-upgrade` suggests changes
- After receiving external audit output (Codex, Gemini, GPT)
- When someone pastes a list of "bugs found" from any LLM
- Before implementing ANY fix list from an LLM source

### When NOT to Use

- For verifying scientific/factual claims (use `/researcher` or `/epistemics`)
- For verifying a single specific bug (just read the code directly)
- When findings are already human-verified

### Procedure

1. **Extract Claims** — Parse the report. Extract every file-specific, verifiable claim. Number each for tracking.
2. **Ground Truth Verification** — For each claim, verify against actual code using the checklist in `lenses/verification.md`.
3. **Synthesis Table** — Produce verification summary with CONFIRMED / CORRECTED / HALLUCINATED / INCONCLUSIVE verdicts.
4. **Action** — Fix ALL CONFIRMED and CORRECTED findings. Never fix HALLUCINATED. Never self-select "top N" from confirmed. If hallucination rate exceeds 40%, warn user the source is unreliable.

### Output Convention

If total findings > 10, write the synthesis table to a file and return the path. Don't dump 30-row tables inline.

---

## Mode: close — Post-Implementation Plan Close

After a plan's implementation is committed, there's a gap between "code works" and "code is correct." Regression tests verify existing behavior doesn't change — but they're blind to bugs in new code paths. This mode closes that gap.

See `lenses/plan-close-review.md` for full workflow, bug class table, and migration checklist.

### Why This Exists

Three independent lines of evidence:

1. **Empirical (suspense accounts, 2026-04-07):** GPT-5.4 found 6 confirmed bugs in freshly committed code. All 74 canary tests and 11 IR invariants passed. The bugs were in new functions with zero test coverage.

2. **Failure Mode 15 — Silent Semantic Failures** (MAS-FIRE, arXiv:2602.19843): Reasoning drift, wrong buckets, misleading diagnostics propagate without runtime exceptions.

3. **Failure Mode 16 — Reward Hacking** (TRACE, arXiv:2601.20103): Agents evaluated by test passage may hack the test rather than solve the task.

### Workflow

**Phase 0: Pre-Close Discipline** — Normalize closeout: separate code/data validation, sync generated docs, prove migration completion. Build review packet:
```bash
uv run python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_plan_close_context.py \
  --repo "$(pwd)" \
  --output .model-review/plan-close-context.md
```

**Phase 1: Write Tests for New Code** — Identify new functions from plan commits. Write unit tests covering happy path, edge cases, error paths, and contract invariants.

**Phase 2: Cross-Model Review** — Run `/review model` on the plan-close review packet (not a hand-written summary). Use `--context .model-review/plan-close-context.md`. Fact-check and disposition every finding.

**Phase 3: The Caught-Red-Handed Loop** — For each confirmed finding: would any Phase 1 tests have caught this? If yes, fix the test gap. If no, write a new test. Verify against pre-fix code:
```bash
git stash
pytest tests/test_<new>.py -x  # should FAIL
git stash pop
pytest tests/test_<new>.py -x  # should PASS
```

**Phase 4: Close the Plan** — Commit tests, update plan status, run `validate-code`, summarize findings.

### When NOT to Use

- Trivial plans (< 30 lines, single function, obvious correctness)
- Research/analysis plans that don't produce code
- Plans that only modify config/data with no logic changes

## Known Issues
<!-- Append-only. Session-analyst may suggest additions. -->
- **[2026-03-27] llmx output flag — never use shell redirects (> file) with llmx; use --output/-o flag instead. Shell redirects buffer until process exit, producing 0-byte files. Fixed in llmx v0.5.0 (2026-03-06).**
- **[2026-04-09] GPT-5.4 xhigh timeout — default llmx timeout is 300s, xhigh needs 900s. Set `--timeout 900` for xhigh, `--timeout 600` for high. Three parallel xhigh calls may hit rate limits — run sequentially or use high effort instead.**
- **[2026-04-09] xhigh vs high for architectural review — marginal quality delta. High-effort adversarial review (4 min) found the sharpest insight across 6 reviews. xhigh (15 min each) had more words, similar signal density. Reserve xhigh for formal math only. For deep dives: 2-3 parallel high queries with focused questions > 1 xhigh mega-query.**
- **[2026-04-09] Context formatting matters — GPT-5.4 performs better with XML `<doc>` tags around context sections. Gemini needs query at END, critical constraints at END. Consult /model-guide before assembling context for manual dispatch.**
